# Terminal and Git- *Cheat Sheet* 
The terminal allows for implementing commands as fast and efficiently as possible. The command line is also where you run all of your Git commands. The following lists display all the commands we learnt today:
# Terminal
## *Where am I?* 🌠
- **'pwd'**: Shows the location of the file you're currently in
- **'cd'**: Moes right back to the user directory 
- **'cd..'**: Moves up one to the parent directory
- **'cd.'**: Moves down one to a child directory
- **'ls'**: Lists everything within the current file
- **'ls -a'**: Lists everything including hidden files
- **'ls -l'**: Lists everything with all details

## *Where can I go?* ✈️
- **'mv [*file name*] [*different file*]'**: Move something to a different location
- **'mv [*file name*] [*new name*]'**: Rename a file 
## *What can I change?* ✏️
- **'rm'**: Remove a file
- **'rm -rf'**: Remove a directory **[^1]**

    ⬆️ ***BE VERY CARFEUL!*** ⬆️
- **'mkdir [*enter name*]'**: Make a new directory 
- **'touch'**: Make a new file

**[^1]** ❗️Be careful: This command has the potential to destroy your computer if you execute it in your home directory❗️

# Git
- **'git init'**: Initialises Git repo (or re-initialises)
- **'git add [*file name*]'**: Makes Git track that file
- **'git commit -m[*describe the changes*]'**: Log the changes you've made (you have to add/stage first)
- **'git push origin main'**- pushes the file to the repo
